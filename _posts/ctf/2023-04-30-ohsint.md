The copyright owner is: `OWoodflint` let's search some information about him.
![OhSINT - Google search](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/02.png){:class="post-image"}

Based on the twitter account, we can see that the user avatar is a `cat`.

## Question 2 - What city is this person in?
![OhSINT - User Tweet](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/03.png){:class="post-image"}
Based on this tweet, we can see that the user Bssid is `B4:5D:50:AA:86:41` and using the website [wigle.net](https://wigle.net/){:target="_blank"} we can get the location of the user starting from the Bssid.
![OhSINT - Wigle search](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/04.png){:class="post-image"}

So the answer is: `London`

## Question 3 - Whats the SSID of the WAP he connected to?
![OhSINT - Wigle search](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/05.png){:class="post-image"}

So the answer is: `UnileverWiFi`

## Question 4 - What is his personal email address?
In the previous google search, we can see that the user has a github account.
The readme file of the repository contains the email address.
![OhSINT - Github account](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/06.png){:class="post-image"}

So the answer is: `OWoodflint@gmail.com`

## Question 5 - What site did you find his email address on?
Easy, the answer is: `GitHub`

## Question 6 - Where has he gone on holiday?
Same google search, we can see that the user has a wordpress account.
The blog post contains the answer.
![OhSINT - Wordpress account](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/07.png){:class="post-image"}

So the answer is: `New York`

## Question 7 - What is this persons password?
This one is tricky. After spending some time searching for the password, I decided to check the rss feed of the blog, to check if there is some post that I missed.
![OhSINT - Wordpress account](/assets/images/ctf-ohsint/08.png){:class="post-image"}
And I found a part of text that I didn't see in the blog post.

So the answer is: `pennYDr0pper.!`
